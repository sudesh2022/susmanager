They can be expressed as\n * either a primitive physical type (bytes or bits of some fixed size), a\n * nested type consisting of other data types, or another data type (e.g. a\n * timestamp encoded as an int64).\n *\n * **Note**: Only enum values 0-17 (NONE through Map) are written to an Arrow\n * IPC payload.\n *\n * The rest of the values are specified here so TypeScript can narrow the type\n * signatures further beyond the base Arrow Types. The Arrow DataTypes include\n * metadata like `bitWidth` that impact the type signatures of the values we\n * accept and return.\n *\n * For example, the `Int8Vector` reads 1-byte numbers from an `Int8Array`, an\n * `Int32Vector` reads a 4-byte number from an `Int32Array`, and an `Int64Vector`\n * reads a pair of 4-byte lo, hi 32-bit integers as a zero-copy slice from the\n * underlying `Int32Array`.\n *\n * Library consumers benefit by knowing the narrowest type, since we can ensure\n * the types across all public methods are propagated, and never bail to `any`.\n * These values are _never_ used at runtime, and they will _never_ be written\n * to the flatbuffers metadata of serialized Arrow IPC payloads.\n */\nexport var Type;\n(function (Type) {\n    /** The default placeholder type */\n    Type[Type[\"NONE\"] = 0] = \"NONE\";\n    /** A NULL type having no physical storage */\n    Type[Type[\"Null\"] = 1] = \"Null\";\n    /** Signed or unsigned 8, 16, 32, or 64-bit little-endian integer */\n    Type[Type[\"Int\"] = 2] = \"Int\";\n    /** 2, 4, or 8-byte floating point value */\n    Type[Type[\"Float\"] = 3] = \"Float\";\n    /** Variable-length bytes (no guarantee of UTF8-ness) */\n    Type[Type[\"Binary\"] = 4] = \"Binary\";\n    /** UTF8 variable-length string as List<Char> */\n    Type[Type[\"Utf8\"] = 5] = \"Utf8\";\n    /** Boolean as 1 bit, LSB bit-packed ordering */\n    Type[Type[\"Bool\"] = 6] = \"Bool\";\n    /** Precision-and-scale-based decimal type.
